### Assignment and Requirements:
Build a simple homepage of your own choice using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Responsive website that I've builded with HTML, CSS/Bootstrap 5 and Javacript.

SkinBuddy aims for improving your skincare routine by let you tracking the products that you're using and get the best outcome from them.
